## Experience Structure

Each experience follows this flow:

```
experiences/[type]/[project-name]/
├── plan.md        # The execution plan
├── research.md    # Research gathered
├── output.md      # The deliverable
├── review.md      # Quality review results
└── learnings.md   # Extracted insights
```

---

## How Experiences Work

1. `/plan` creates the plan.md
2. `/work` creates the output.md
3. `/review` creates the review.md
4. `/learn` creates the learnings.md and updates patterns
