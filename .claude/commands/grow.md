## Brain Health Report

### Step 1: Gather Metrics

**Analyzing brain state...**

```
Read brain-health/growth-log.md
Read brain-health/pattern-confidence.md
Read brain-health/quality-metrics.md
Read brain-health/backlog.md
Count files in memory/patterns/
Count files in experiences/
```

### Step 2: Calculate Growth

**Computing compound intelligence metrics...**

## Overview

[Visual health indicator]

🧠 ████████████░░░░ 75% Health Score

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Change | Trend |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Total Patterns | [X] | +[N] this week | 📈 |
| HIGH Confidence | [X] | +[N] this week | 📈 |
| Experiences Logged | [X] | +[N] this week | 📈 |
| Avg Review Score | [X.X] | +[X.X] this week | 📈 |

## Pattern Health

### By Confidence Level

```
HIGH   ████████░░ [X] patterns
MEDIUM ████░░░░░░ [X] patterns
LOW    ██░░░░░░░░ [X] patterns
```

### Recent Pattern Activity

| Pattern | Confidence | Last Evidence | Uses |
|---------|------------|---------------|------|
| [Pattern 1] | HIGH | [date] | [X] |
| [Pattern 2] | MEDIUM | [date] | [X] |
| [Pattern 3] | LOW | [date] | [X] |

### Patterns Ready for Upgrade

These patterns have enough evidence to increase confidence:

- [ ] **[Pattern name]**: LOW → MEDIUM (needs 1 more success)
- [ ] **[Pattern name]**: MEDIUM → HIGH (needs 2 more successes)

## Experience Health

### Total Experiences: [X]

```
This week:   ██████ [X]
Last week:   ████ [X]
This month:  ████████████████ [X]
```

### By Type

| Type | Count | Avg Score |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Prospects | [X] | [X.X] |
| [Other] | [X] | [X.X] |

### Quality Distribution

```
9-10 (Excellent) ████████ [X]
7-8 (Good)       ████████████ [X]
5-6 (Acceptable) ████ [X]
1-4 (Needs Work) ██ [X]
```

## Compound Returns

### Time Savings Estimate

Based on pattern reuse and accumulated knowledge:

| Activity | Without Brain | With Brain | Savings |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------|
| Research | ~30 min | ~10 min | 67% |
| Drafting | ~45 min | ~20 min | 56% |
| Review cycles | ~3 rounds | ~1 round | 67% |
| **Total per project** | ~2 hours | ~45 min | **63%** |

### Knowledge Compound Rate

```
Week 1:  ██ Base knowledge
Week 2:  ████ +[X] patterns
Week 3:  ██████ +[X] patterns
Week 4:  ████████ +[X] patterns
Current: ██████████████ [Total] patterns
```

## Recommendations

### To Improve Brain Health:

1. **[Recommendation 1]**
   - [Specific action]
   - Impact: [what it improves]

2. **[Recommendation 2]**
   - [Specific action]
   - Impact: [what it improves]

3. **[Recommendation 3]**
   - [Specific action]
   - Impact: [what it improves]

## Next Actions

Feed your brain:
```bash
/plan [next task]
```

Complete a cycle:
```bash
/plan → /work → /review → /learn
```

Check specific patterns:
```bash
/recall [topic]
```
```

## Health Status Levels

| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| THRIVING | 20+ patterns, 10+ HIGH confidence, consistent quality | Keep going! |
| GROWING | 10+ patterns, some HIGH confidence, improving scores | On track |
| HEALTHY | 5+ patterns, regular /learn cycles | Building momentum |
| NEEDS ATTENTION | Few patterns, inconsistent learning | Complete more cycles |
| EMPTY | No patterns, no experiences | Run /setup, start first cycle |

## Understanding Compound Returns

### How Compounding Works

```
Cycle 1: Learn basic patterns
    ↓
Cycle 2: Apply patterns + learn refinements
    ↓
Cycle 3: Refined patterns + learn new insights
    ↓
Cycle N: Deep expertise compounds automatically
```

### What Compounds

1. **Patterns** - Each success reinforces what works
2. **Quality** - Review scores improve as patterns are applied
3. **Speed** - Familiar patterns execute faster
4. **Consistency** - Brand voice strengthens over time
5. **Insights** - Customer knowledge deepens

### Measuring ROI

After 10+ cycles, expect:
- 50%+ time reduction on similar tasks
- Higher first-draft quality (fewer review cycles)
- Consistent voice and positioning
- Accumulated customer insights

---

## Growth Tips

### Accelerate Growth

1. **Complete full cycles** - Don't skip /learn
2. **Feed examples** - Add winning work to memory/examples/
3. **Track patterns** - Note what works repeatedly
4. **Review weekly** - Check /grow to see progress

### Avoid Stagnation

1. **Don't skip /learn** - Knowledge slips away
2. **Don't ignore patterns** - Apply what you've learned
3. **Don't work without /plan** - Context gets lost
4. **Don't skip /review** - Quality doesn't improve

---

## Brain Health Maintenance

### Weekly Check-in

```bash
/grow
# Review metrics
# Identify patterns ready for upgrade
# Note any gaps in memory
```

### Monthly Review

- Review all HIGH confidence patterns
- Archive outdated patterns
- Update memory/company/ if business changed
- Clean up experiences/ if needed

### Quarterly Assessment

- Full memory audit
- Pattern relevance check
- ROI calculation
- Goal reassessment

---

## Troubleshooting

### Brain feels stagnant?

- Complete 3+ full cycles without skipping /learn
- Add more context to memory/company/
- Feed examples of excellent work

### Not seeing time savings?

- Ensure you're applying patterns (check in /plan)
- Review pattern confidence levels
- Complete more cycles to build compound effect

### Quality not improving?

- Review /review feedback consistently
- Update patterns based on what works
- Check brand voice examples
