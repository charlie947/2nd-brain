## What is This?

An AI Second Brain is a Claude Code project structure that:

- **Remembers** your business context, products, and customers
- **Learns** patterns from your best work
- **Improves** output quality over time
- **Accelerates** repeated tasks through accumulated wisdom

---

## One-Click Setup

### Option 1: Use GitHub Template (Recommended)

1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button above
2. Name your repository (e.g., `my-second-brain`)
3. Clone your new repository
4. Open in Claude Code and run `/setup`

### Option 2: Clone Directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DamnPhysicks/second-brain-template.git my-second-brain
cd my-second-brain
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: My AI Second Brain"
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare (30 minutes before)

Review the [Pre-Session Checklist](docs/pre-session-checklist.md) to:
- Install required tools (Node.js, Git, GitHub CLI, Claude Code)
- Gather 5-20 writing samples for voice capture
- Reflect on your business foundation

### 2. Open in Claude Code

```bash
cd my-second-brain
claude
```

### 3. Run Guided Setup (45 minutes)

```
/setup
```

This launches an **interview-based onboarding** - no forms to fill out. I'll ask questions, you talk, and your brain gets populated with structured content. You can pause and resume anytime.

**The 7 Phases:**
| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Scope | 2 min | Business, Personal, or Hybrid |
| Identity | 5 min | Who you are, what drains you |
| Foundation | 10 min | Why, Vision, Mission, Values |
| Products | 10 min | Services, ICP, Differentiation |
| Voice | 10 min | Analyze your writing samples |
| First Win | 5 min | Demo the brain with YOUR context |
| Gaps | 3 min | Todo list for remaining setup |

### 4. Get Your First Win

After setup, try:
```
/ask "Help me write a follow-up email to a prospect"
```

## Core Workflow

```
/plan [task]  -->  /work  -->  /review  -->  /learn
     │              │            │            │

  + Plan        with todo    quality      patterns

Each cycle makes your brain smarter.

## After Setup: The 4-Command Workflow

Your brain works best with this systematic approach:

```
/plan [task]  →  /work [plan]  →  /review [output]  →  /learn
    ↓               ↓                  ↓                 ↓
 Research       Execute with       6-agent           Extract
 + Plan         todo tracking      quality check     patterns
```

**First project recommendation:**
1. Pick a real task you need to do
2. Run `/plan [your task]` - get a structured plan
3. Run `/work [plan file]` - execute with tracking
4. Run `/review [output]` - 6-agent quality check
5. Run `/learn` - extract patterns for next time

Each cycle makes your brain smarter.
