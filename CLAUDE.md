## The 4-Command Workflow

This brain uses a systematic approach to every task:

```
/plan [task]  →  /work [plan]  →  /review [output]  →  /learn
    ↓               ↓                  ↓                 ↓
 Research       Execute with       6-agent           Extract
 + Plan         todo tracking      quality check     patterns
```

### Command Reference

| Command | Purpose | Time |
|---------|---------|------|
| `/start` | First win in 30 seconds | 30 sec |
| `/setup` | Guided brain configuration | 10 min |
| `/plan [task]` | Create systematic execution plan | 2-3 min |
| `/work [plan.md]` | Execute with todo tracking | Varies |
| `/review [output.md]` | 6-agent parallel quality review | 30 sec |
| `/learn` | Extract patterns to memory | 3 min |
| `/recall [topic]` | Search memory for relevant context | 10 sec |
| `/grow` | View brain health metrics | 5 sec |

## Skill Unlock Progress

Track your mastery level:

### Level 1: Foundation
- [ ] Run `/ask` for first quick win
- [ ] Fill `memory/values-beliefs/` with core values and frameworks
- [ ] Fill `memory/personal/` basics (expertise, services, positioning)
- [ ] Populate `memory/style-voice/` with writing guidelines

### Level 2: Core Workflow
- [ ] Complete first `/plan → /work → /review → /learn` cycle
- [ ] See first pattern extracted to memory
- [ ] Achieve 8+ quality score on /review

### Level 3: Pattern Power
- [ ] Have 5+ patterns in memory
- [ ] See time savings on repeated task types
- [ ] Have at least one HIGH confidence pattern

### Level 4: Expert Mode
- [ ] 20+ experiences logged
- [ ] Consistent 9+ quality scores
- [ ] Compound time savings visible in /grow

---

## MCP Integrations (Optional)

Enhance your brain with external tools:

- **LinkedIn**: Professional context discovery
- **Google Workspace**: Calendar, email, docs access
- **Custom MCPs**: Add your own integrations

Configure in: `~/.claude/mcp.json`

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always /plan first** - Never jump straight into work
2. **Complete the cycle** - /plan → /work → /review → /learn
3. **Trust the /review** - 6 agents catch what you miss
4. **Feed the brain** - Run /learn after every project
5. **Check /grow weekly** - See your compound returns

---

## Troubleshooting

### Brain feels empty?
- Fill `memory/values-beliefs/` with your core values and frameworks
- Populate `memory/personal/` with your expertise and positioning
- Capture writing samples in `memory/style-voice/examples.md`
- Complete one full cycle to seed patterns

### /review too harsh?
- Review agents calibrate over time
- Feed them examples in `memory/examples/`
- They learn your brand voice through patterns

### Not seeing improvements?
- Run `/grow` to check metrics
- Ensure you're running `/learn` after each project
- Check `brain-health/pattern-confidence.md`
