# Memory Index

Your brain's semantic memory - the knowledge that persists across all projects.

## Structure

### Core Context (Fill First)
- `values-beliefs/` - Your core values, beliefs, and frameworks
- `style-voice/` - Your writing style and tone
- `personal/` - Your expertise, services, and positioning
- `audience/` - Your ideal clients and their needs

### Patterns & Examples
- `patterns/` - Extracted wisdom from your work (grows with /learn)
- `examples/` - Your best content organized by type

### Knowledge Repository
- `knowledge-repo/` - Your idea vault (ideas, concepts, insights, papers)

### Business Context
- `company/` - Products, positioning, differentiators
- `customers/` - ICP, pain points, objections

## Getting Started

1. Run `/setup` to be guided through populating your memory
2. Or manually fill in the template files in each folder
3. The more context you add, the smarter your brain becomes

## Tips

- Be specific in your values and beliefs - vague context = vague output
- Add real examples of your best work to `examples/`
- Run `/learn` after every project to grow your patterns
